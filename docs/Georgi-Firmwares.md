# How to get devel, contribute or hack on your chords
I maintain a branch on github for all my development work, this is where we submit PRs to QMK master from. To get it.

~~~~
git clone https://github.com/germ/qmk\_firmware.git
git checkout georgi
make georgi:default:dfu
~~~~

If you make changes, come up with funky layouts and all that. Submit a PR and we'll merge it and bundle it together with our next push to master!
